# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the prices of cars based on various features using machine learning techniques. The model aims to assist users in understanding how car attributes influence their market value.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- **Feature Selection**: Identify significant features affecting car prices.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict car prices with high accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes attributes such as car make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and other features.
- Ensure the dataset is placed in the required directory or imported within the notebook.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
